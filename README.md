# smart-contract-solidity
The Objective of this assignment is to deploy your own smart contracts using the Remix IDE. We will be building a simple escrow contract between two parties Alice and Bob. Alice will
transfer money to a contract and Bob will be able to withdraw from this contract after a fixed
amount of time.
For the final submission I will be deploying the contract to the Goerli Testnet.
Bobâ€™s address will be : 0xECf74C19215C8DD2BAF16AD3a6eC1A25386d813c
Alice's Address: Any address
The time after which bob can withdraw is 1 day after Alice has deposited the money.
